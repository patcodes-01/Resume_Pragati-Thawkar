Hey there! 

I'm Pragati, a student who delves into web development, competitive programming and web content curation. 

Currently, I’m a second-year student at IIIT Pune, delving into C, C++, Python, Java and web development(HTML, CSS, JavaScript) . I have a grip on data structures and algorithms, backed by solving over 150+ problems on LeetCode and 200+ questions on other coding platforms.

I have completed coursework in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Database Management Systems (DBMS), Theory of Computation(TOC), Object-Oriented Programming Systems (OOPS), Analysis and Design of Algorithms(AADA). 

Beyond academics, I’m actively involved in community building as part of the IIITians Network. I enjoy creating impactful content incorporating SEO, whether through posts, event coverage, or creative campaigns that bring students together.

When I’m not coding or curating web content, I dive into my hobbies. I’m a speedcuber who loves the thrill of solving puzzles quickly, a fan of watching documentaries to gain new perspectives, and someone who enjoys engaging in conversations about anything under the sun—be it tech, culture, or random ideas. My thirst for knowledge and curiosity drive me to learn and grow beyond the classroom.

Let's connect then—I’m always up for new opportunities and collaborations!
